Dijkstra's Algorithm Calculator

This is a simple web app that shows the shortest path between two nodes using Dijkstra's Algorithm. Users choose a start and end node, and the app displays the best path and total distance.

Tech Stack

- ASP.NET Core Razor Pages
- HTML5 & CSS3
- JavaScript 
- Bootstrap 5


 How It Works

- A hardcoded graph is defined in JavaScript.
- On form submission, the Dijkstra algorithm computes the shortest path.
- Results are displayed in a result box on the right side of the layout.
